            I am a philosopher working on feminist epistemology, political
            philosophy, and philosophy of language. In my research, I ask how we
            can know about injustice. Or, in other words, I ask how social
            critique is possible. Currently, I am interested in utopian thinking
            as one means of social critique.

            Until summer 2025, I am a Research Fellow at Jesus College,
            Cambridge. Before that, I was a student at Newnham College in
            Cambridge for many years. I also spent some time at Humboldt
            Universität, Berlin, CUNY, New York, and ETH in Zürich.

          <p>
            From September 2025, I will be joining Utrecht University as
            Assistant Professor in Social and Political Philosophy.
